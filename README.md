Btw I'm the creator

I will be posting a video on how to do this on "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDoHZ-pxuWrP92A4MfPydyg?view_as=subscriber" 
for even more info  

---------------------------------------------------------IMPORTANT------------------------------------------------------

If you got this from discord read this, but if your from github you don't need to.
ALSO RIGHT CLICK ON YOUR DESKTOP AND ADD A NEW FILE AND NAME IT "Discord Nuke Bot" Thats where your going to have to put all of the
files I sent you. 

**npm install discord.js**

-----------------------------------------------Set=Up---------------------------------------

MAKE SURE YOU PUT THE FILE (Discord Nuke Bot) ON YOUR DESKTOP

1. Install Node.js "https://nodejs.org/en/download/" Make sure you pick the right operation system.

2. Install VS code "https://code.visualstudio.com/" if you use a diffrent operating system then windows, click other platforms under it. Make sure you put VS code on your desktop.

3. Install Javascript "https://java.com/en/download/" (:

4. Go this page, "https://discord.com/developers/applications" and login to your discord (yes this site is an official site by 
Discord) once you are there, you should see a button that says "New Application" please click that and name it whatever you want 
it to be. Now you can put a custom image for your discord bot. Now Go to Bot at the middle left side and click the button
that says "Add Bot". Now go to OAuth2, scroll down and click on the button Bot and then click on administrator.
You should see a link that says something like "https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=" at the begining of it, click
copy and paste it into another tab (when inviting make sure you have administator or it wont work). Now after you invited the bot 
to your server you want to nuke... (you monster) please go back to "https://discord.com/developers/applications" and open up your 
project. Then click on Bot and under Token click on copy (Never give out your token because that gives full access for anyone to
your bot.)

5. Once you have your bot token copied, go to the discord nuke bot file and drag it into VS code. 

6. After you did #5 go to Nuke.js and scroll all the way down and you will see
"nuke.login("Your token here");" Ctrl V the token into there and your all set. (Put it between the quotes.) Once your done simply open up terminal and type **npm install discord.js** and close out of VS. Code and go back to the file 
"Discord Nuke Bot" and click on the Bat file "Start". 

6. If you have any questions please feel free to dm Foski#4619 or just watch the video on "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDoHZ-pxuWrP92A4MfPydyg?view_as=subscriber"

-----------------------------------------------Tips=and=Tricks-----------------------------------------

1. If you got to the top of the file Nuke.js in VS code, you will see a code line "nuke.user.setPresence({ game: { name: `Helpful Discord Bot :) ` }, type: 0 });" if you take the 
"Helpful Discord Bot :)" and change it with anything, it will change what the status of the bot says Via Discord. 

2. BTW THE WAY TO ACCESS THE BOT IS "n!help" It will give you all of the commands. (Sorry for the people who had problems with it)
